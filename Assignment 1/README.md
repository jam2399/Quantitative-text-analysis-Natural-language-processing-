# MY459 Quantitative Text Analysis

## Assignment 1

The goal of the first part of assignment 1 is to make sure you know how to work with GitHub Classroom in order to access, complete, and submit assignments. For the second part of the assignment you work through an RMarkdown document and fill in R code and answers to questions on text analysis.

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. Remember that we will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown files (in .html format). You can add your responses in italics so that it's easier for us to read them.

This is an individual assignment. You can discuss the assignment with other students, but the code should yours.

Submissions without an html file will receive 0 points.

**Deadline: Monday 4 February 2019 11.59pm**

1.  Getting familiar with GitHub Classroom Workflow

    - Edit the Markdown document [`information.md`](information.md) to include your own details. Follow the instructions in [`GIT.md`](GIT.md) to commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

2.  Look at [`assignment1.Rmd`](assignment1.Rmd). Add the missing code and write up the answers. Commit and push this change as above.

Congratulations, you are finished!

#### Submitting your assignment

__You do not have to and cannot actively submit your assignment!__

How "submission" works in GitHub classroom:

1. Make changes in your personal assignment repository and push them to GitHub.
2. When the moment the assignment is due, GitHub will take a snapshot of the current state of your personal assignment repository. This snapshot is your submission.

So all you need to do is to make sure that you:

1. Make your changes before the deadline
2. __Publish your local changes to GitHub before the deadline__

# MY459 Quantitative Text Analysis

## Assignment 3

In this second assignment, you will need to work through an RMarkdown document and fill in R code and answers to questions on text analysis.

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. Remember that we will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown files (in .html format). You can add your responses in italics so that it's easier for us to read them.

This is an individual assignment.

Submissions without an html file will receive 0 points.

**Deadline: March 11 March 2019 11.59pm**

#### Submitting your assignment

__You do not have to and cannot actively submit your assignment!__

How "submission" works in GitHub classroom:

1. Make changes in your personal assignment repository and push them to GitHub.
2. When the moment the assignment is due, GitHub will take a snapshot of the current state of your personal assignment repository. This snapshot is your submission.

So all you need to do is to make sure that you:

1. Make your changes before the deadline
2. __Publish your local changes to GitHub before the deadline__
